# stargui

This is a test repository to create a UI for a larger project. The larger project is an 80s style, multiplayer, educational video game for children to teach them about finite state machines and swarm algorithms. We are using Processing and Java to build our own physics and game engine.

The creation of the video is a project undertaken by a group of 7 master students from the University of Bristol. 

The repository for the larger game, still under development, can be found here: https://github.com/lao8n/battlestar.
