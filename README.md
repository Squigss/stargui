# stargui

This is a test repository to create a UI for a larger project. The larger project is an 80s style educational video game.
The creation of the video is a project undertaken by a group of 7 master students from the University of Bristol. 

The repository for the larger game, still under development can be found here: https://github.com/lao8n/battlestar
